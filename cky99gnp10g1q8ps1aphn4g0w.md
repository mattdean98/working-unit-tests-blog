## You NEED to read these books

# Introduction 

> "A reader lives a thousand lives before he dies. The man who never reads lives only one." - George R.R. Martin

As developers our lives are FILLED with constantly learning new things. Be it a new programming language, new best practice or new framework - to name just a few! 

After some time digging into a few books, here are some that I highly recommend you explore this year! If you have listen to my most recent podcast, Episode 10 "New Year, New You" (and if not, you should really [give it a try](https://anchor.fm/workingunittests/episodes/10-New-Year-New-You-e1chaaa)), you might be looking around for options on what sort of books might be worth looking into! 

Here is a short list of a few books I highly recommend!

# The books

1. **Pragmatic Programmer** by *David Thomas and Andrew Hunt*
  
This book is excellent, many short chapters about how to start a project, work under managers, find the right tools for the job and work as a team.

1. **Clean Code** by *Robert C. Martin*

Another **great** book to read as a software developer, Robert C. Martin gives tips and tricks for anything from naming variables, organizing functions, writing unit tests, good vs. bad comments, error handling and more. 

1. **Soft Skills** by *John Sonmez*

A book I haven't seen too much buzz about myself, but a very handy book for those developers who want insights into focusing, negotiating salaries, productivity, finances and more! Not so much technical - but being a developer is more than just 0s and 1s!
